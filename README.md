# Posts with Todos Application

## Overview

This project is a React + Redux application that fetches data from two API endpoints (`posts` and `todos`) provided by [JSONPlaceholder](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com). It combines them to display a list of posts along with their `userId`, `title`, and `completed` status. Additionally, the application allows users to add a new post using the POST method using form.

---

## Features

- Fetches posts from `/posts` and todos from `/todos`.
- Combines posts with their corresponding `completed` status from todos.
- Displays the combined data in a table format.
- Built with:
  - **React** for UI components.
  - **Redux Toolkit** for state management and API integration.
  - **TypeScript** for type safety.
  - **Axios** as the HTTP client.
  - **CSS** for styling

---

## Approach Taken

### 1. Setting Up Redux Toolkit

- Used **Redux Toolkit's** `createApi` to define endpoints for fetching posts and todos.
- Created a central store with `configureStore` to manage the state and integrate API slices.

### 2. Data Fetching

- Defined two API endpoints:
  - `/posts` for fetching posts.
  - `/todos` for fetching todos.
- Used the hooks generated by `createApi` (`useFetchPostsQuery` and `useFetchTodosQuery`) to retrieve data.

### 3. Combining Data

- The `id` field in both `posts` and `todos` was used as the key to combine data.
- Each post was enhanced with a `completed` field by finding a matching todo using its `id`.
- Defaulted `completed` to `false` if no corresponding todo was found.

### 4. Displaying Data

- Created a list component (`PostList`) to display:
  - `userId`: From the posts data.
  - `title`: From the posts data.
  - `completed`: From the todos data.
- Rendered the combined data in a clean, readable format.

### 5. Additions

- The application handles loading and error states gracefully.
- Combined data is presented dynamically by fetching and merging results at runtime.
